{% docs player_impact_score %}
**Player Impact Score** is a simplified, per-minute efficiency metric inspired by PER (Player Efficiency Rating).

Itâ€™s calculated as:  
\[
(points + rebounds + assists + steals + blocks - turnovers) / minutes\_played
\]

This metric gives a quick estimate of player productivity per minute of play.
